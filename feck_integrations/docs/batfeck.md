# `batfeck`: Your Terminal's Lovely Horse for Viewing Files

Ah, `batfeck`! It's like your trusty lovely horse, always there to help you see things clearly, even when your `bat` command has gone a bit... *wobbly*. We all know `bat` is brilliant for pretty-printing files, but sometimes, just sometimes, it throws a wobbly. That's where `batfeck` gallops in!

`batfeck` is a delightful wrapper around `bat`. You use it just like you would `bat`, but if `bat` decides to have a moment of existential crisis (or you just type something wrong), `feck` will pop up to offer a friendly correction. It's a bit like having someone gently remind you, "Go on, go on, go on!" when you're stuck.

## How to Use `batfeck` (It's as Easy as Falling Over!)

Simply replace your usual `bat` command with `batfeck`.

```bash
# Instead of:
bat my_script.py

# Use:
batfeck my_script.py
```

If `batfeck` detects an issue, `feck` will then offer a correction, just like it does for any other command.

## Examples (Sure, Why Not?)

### Example 1: When `bat` Can't Find the File (Oh, the Humanity!)

```bash
➜ batfeck non_existent_file.txt
Error: The file 'non_existent_file.txt' could not be found.

Oh, feck! It seems 'bat' had a bit of a wobble. Let's see if 'feck' can sort it out...
Failed command: bat non_existent_file.txt
feck
# feck will then suggest a correction, perhaps for a typo in the filename!
```

### Example 2: When You Misspell a `bat` Option (Classic!)

```bash
➜ batfeck --them TwoDark my_code.js
Error: unknown flag '--them'

Oh, feck! It seems 'bat' had a bit of a wobble. Let's see if 'feck' can sort it out...
Failed command: bat --them TwoDark my_code.js
feck
# feck will likely suggest: bat --theme TwoDark my_code.js
```

## Super Creative Component: The "Ted" Test for Readability!

Ever wonder if your code is so clean and readable that even someone who's never seen a computer could understand it? Now you can! Pipe your code through `batfeck` and imagine explaining it to someone who thinks the internet is a series of tubes. If you can't, `feck` might just suggest you simplify your life (or your code!).

```bash
# Is your Python script as clear as a lovely day on Craggy Island?
cat my_complex_script.py | batfeck --language=python

# If batfeck (and feck) can't make sense of it, maybe it's time for a cup of tea and a rethink!
```

`batfeck` is here to make your file viewing experience less of a "down with this sort of thing" moment and more of a "that would be an ecumenical matter!" triumph. Enjoy!
