# `curlfeck`: Your Terminal's Cup of Tea for Web Woes

Ah, `curlfeck`! When your `curl` command goes a bit *wobbly*, or perhaps you've just had a bit too much sacramental wine and can't quite remember the syntax, `curlfeck` is here to offer a helping hand. It's like a warm cup of tea and a friendly chat, sorting out your web requests with a minimum of fuss.

`curlfeck` is a charming wrapper around the mighty `curl`. You use it just like you would `curl`, but if `curl` decides to throw a tantrum (or you've made a classic typo), `feck` will gracefully step in to offer a correction. It's a bit like having someone gently remind you, "Careful now, steady on!" when you're about to make a mess.

## How to Use `curlfeck` (Sure, It's Grand!)

Simply replace your usual `curl` command with `curlfeck`.

```bash
# Instead of:
curl https://example.com/api/data

# Use:
curlfeck https://example.com/api/data
```

If `curlfeck` detects an issue, `feck` will then offer a correction, just like it does for any other command.

## Examples (Go On, Go On, Go On!)

### Example 1: When `curl` Can't Resolve the Host (A Bit of a Puzzler!)

```bash
➜ curlfeck htts://misspelled-website.com
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: htts://misspelled-website.com

Oh, feck! It seems 'curl' had a bit of a kerfuffle. Let's see if 'feck' can sort it out...
Failed command: curl htts://misspelled-website.com
feck
# feck will then suggest: curl https://misspelled-website.com
```

### Example 2: When You Forget a `curl` Option (It Happens to the Best of Us!)

```bash
➜ curlfeck -X POST -d '{"key": "value"}' http://localhost:8080/api/send
curl: (3) URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL

Oh, feck! It seems 'curl' had a bit of a kerfuffle. Let's see if 'feck' can sort it out...
Failed command: curl -X POST -d '{"key": "value"}' http://localhost:8080/api/send
feck
# feck might suggest adding --header or fixing the URL format!
```

## Super Creative Component: The "Lovely Girls" Web Scraper!

Ever wanted to quickly check if a website is as lovely as it seems? Use `curlfeck` to fetch its content. If `curlfeck` (and subsequently `feck`) can't even get a proper response, perhaps the website is a bit of a *liar*! It's a simple test, but sometimes the simplest things are the most profound.

```bash
# Is this website truly lovely, or is it just pretending?
curlfeck https://some-website-that-might-be-dodgy.com

# If feck can't even get a connection, you know it's time to move on to something more... wholesome.
```

`curlfeck` is here to ensure your web interactions are less of a "brick on the head" moment and more of a "that's a lovely cup of tea!" success. Enjoy!
